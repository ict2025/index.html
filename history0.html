<h3>Who Invented AI?</h3>
  <p>John McCarthy is often credited with inventing artificial intelligence (AI). He was an American computer scientist who coined the term in 1955. However, AI was the result of the collaborative efforts of many researchers over decades.</p>

  <h3>1943</h3>
  <p>Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts present their model of artificial neurons, which is considered the first AI.</p>

  <h3>1950</h3>
  <p>Alan Turing publishes Computing Machinery and Intelligence, which includes the idea of the Turing Test.</p>

  <h3>1952</h3>
  <p>Arthur Samuel develops a program that learns to play checkers independently.</p>

  <h3>1955</h3>
  <p>John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon coin the term "artificial intelligence" at a Dartmouth College workshop.</p>

<h2>Early Days (1950s - 1970s): The Dawn of AI</h2>
            <p>The field of AI officially began in 1956 at the Dartmouth Workshop, where the term "artificial intelligence" was coined. Early AI research focused on symbolic reasoning, problem-solving, and game playing. Programs like the Logic Theorist and the General Problem Solver demonstrated impressive capabilities for their time.</p>

            <h2>The AI Winters (1970s - 1980s): Challenges and Setbacks</h2>
            <p>Progress slowed during the "AI winters," periods of reduced funding and interest. Limitations in computing power and the difficulty of tackling complex real-world problems contributed to this slowdown. Expert systems, which used rule-based systems to mimic human expertise, emerged as a significant area of research during this time.</p>

            <h2>The Rise of Machine Learning (1990s - Present): A New Era</h2>
            <p>The advent of more powerful computers and the development of new machine learning algorithms led to a resurgence in AI research. Machine learning, which allows computers to learn from data without explicit programming, became a dominant approach. This era saw breakthroughs in areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and robotics.</p>

            <h2>Deep Learning and Beyond (2010s - Present): The Current Landscape</h2>
            <p>Deep learning, a subfield of machine learning using artificial neural networks with multiple layers, has driven many recent AI advances. Deep learning models have achieved remarkable results in various tasks, from image classification to machine translation. The field continues to evolve rapidly, with ongoing research into areas like reinforcement learning, explainable AI, and ethical considerations.</p>
